# Customer Call Data Cleaning using Pandas

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing customer call data using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library. The main objectives include:

1.Handling missing values
2.Splitting a single column into multiple columns
3.Formatting the columns
4.Performing essential data cleaning and transformations

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
... pip install pandas numpy 
Google Collab & Jupyter Notebook actually have these pre installed.All you need to do is Import the essential libraries.

## Dataset
The project works with customer call data stored in an Excel file.

## Technology Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyXL
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to clean and structure raw customer call data efficiently using Pandas. By handling missing values and transforming data into a structured format, we ensure better data quality for analysis and decision-making.
